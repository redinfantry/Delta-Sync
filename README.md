This tool is a type of software tool that is designed to enable remote control of a computer system or network. These tools are often used by cyber attackers to gain unauthorized access to a victim's computer or network.

This tool consists of two components: the client-side component, which is installed on the victim's computer, and the server-side component, which is installed on the attacker's computer or server. The client-side component will typically run in the background and be disguised as legitimate software or a benign process, allowing the attacker to maintain control over the victim's computer without being detected.

The server-side component is used by the attacker to issue commands to the client-side component, allowing them to remotely execute a variety of actions on the victim's computer. This can include tasks such as capturing keystrokes, stealing sensitive data, launching attacks against other systems, and even completely taking over the victim's computer.
